# 141 Linked List Cycle(Top Interview 150)

Given head, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.

There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer is connected to. Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.

Return true if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return false.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).
```

```
Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: true
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 0th node.
```

```
Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: false
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of the nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 10⁴]`.
- `-10⁵ <= Node.val <= 10⁵`
- `pos` is `-1` or a **valid index** in the linked-list.

**Follow up:** Can you solve it using `O(1)` (i.e. constant) memory?

## Approach

### Set Method

| Technique    | Method    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Two Pointers | Traversal | O(n)            | O(n)             |

#### Two Pointers

- `curr`: pointing to current node, initially `head`.
- `passedNode`: a `Set` to store visited nodes.

#### Traversal Steps

- Condition: While `curr` is not `null`.
- Step:
  1. If `passedNode.has(curr)` return `true`.
  2. Add `curr` to `passedNode`.
  3. Move `curr` one step forward.
  4. If loop ends return `false`.

  ```
  [head] → [node1] → [node2] → [node3] → [node4]
                  ↑                       |
                  └───────── (back to node2) ← cycle
  ```

#### Code Skeleton:

```
let curr = head;
let passedNode = new Set();

while (curr) {
    if (passedNode.has(curr)) return true;
    passedNode.add(curr);
    curr = curr.next;
}

return false;
```

### Fast & Slow Pointer Method

| Technique    | Method    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------ | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Two Pointers | Traversal | O(n)            | O(1) ✅          |

#### Two Pointers

- `slow`: pointing to current node, initially `head`.
- `fast`: pointing to current node, initially `head`.

#### Traversal Steps

- Condition: While `fast` and `fast.next` are not `null`.
- Step:
  1. Move `slow` one step forward.
  2. Move `fast` two step forward.
  3. If `slow == fast` return true.
  4. If loop ends return `false`.

  ```
  slow → [head] → [node1] → [node2] → [node3] → [node4]
  fast → [head] → [node2] → [node4] → [node2] → [node4]
                                                   ↑
                                                 cycle
  ```

## Notes

- `Set` stores **node references**, not values, so `has()` can detect if we visited the same node object before.
- This method uses **O(n) extra space** because every visited node is stored.
- To optimize space to O(1), use the **fast & slow pointer method** instead.
  - Make sure to check both `fast` and `fast.next` in the loop condition to avoid null pointer errors.
  - If there is a cycle, `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet.
