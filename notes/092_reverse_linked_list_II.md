# 92 Reverse Linked List II

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the _reversed list_.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `-500 <= Node.val <= 500`
- `1 <= left <= right <= n`

**Follow up:** Could you do it in one pass?

## Approach

| Technique      | Method    | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| -------------- | --------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| Three Pointers | Traversal | O(n)            | O(1)             |

### Initialization

- `dummy`: a new `ListNode(0, head)` to simplify building the resulting list, especially when `left = 1`.
- `leftPrev`: points to the node **before the left node**. If `left = 1`, this is the dummy.
- `leftNode`: points to the node at position `left`.

### Two Pointers

- `prev`: points to the previous node, initially `null`.
- `curr`: points to the current node, initially `leftNode`.
- `temp`: temporarily variable to store the next node(`curr.next`).

### Traversal

- Condition: from `left` to `right`.
- Step:
  1. Store `curr.next` in `temp` to not lose track of the next node.
  2. Point `curr.next` to `prev` to reverse the link.
  3. Move `prev` to `curr` to advance the previous pointer.
  4. Move `curr` to `temp` to process the next node.
- After the loop:
  1. Connects `leftPrev.next` to the new head of the reversed segment.
  2. Connects `leftNode.next` to the node after the reversed segment.

## Notes

- `left` and `right` mean the node **position**, not value.
- If `left` same with `right`, no reversal is needed.
- Use a **dummy node** to handle cases when `left = 1`.
