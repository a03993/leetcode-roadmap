# 206 Reverse Linked List

## Problem Description

Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [5,4,3,2,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-5000 <= Node.val <= 5000`

## Approach

Describe the algorithm, technique, and complexity.

**Algorithm:** Traversal
**Technique:** Three Pointers

- Initialize three pointers:
  1. `prev` = null (previous node)
  2. `curr` = head (current node)
  3. `temp` = null (to temporarily store next node)

- Traverse the list:
  1. `temp = curr.next`
  2. `curr.next = prev`
  3. `prev = curr`
  4. `curr = temp`

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

## Implementation Notes

- Always store `curr.next` in `temp` before updating `curr.next`
- Updating pointers in order: `curr.next = prev` â†’ `prev = curr` â†’ `curr = temp`
- `prev` at the end is the reversed list
