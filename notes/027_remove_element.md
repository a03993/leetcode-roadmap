Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `val`, remove all occurrences of `val` in `nums` **in-place**. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return _the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val`_.

Consider the number of elements in `nums` which are not equal to `val` be `k`, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

- Change the array `nums` such that the first `k` elements of `nums` contain the elements which are not equal to `val`. The remaining elements of `nums` are not important as well as the size of `nums`.
- Return `k`.

**Custom Judge:**

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

```
int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
```

If all assertions pass, then your solution will be **accepted**.

**Example:**

```java
Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

```java
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2,3,0,4,2], val = 2
Output: 5, nums = [0,1,4,0,3,_,_,_]
// Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums containing 0, 0, 1, 3, and 4.
// Note that the five elements can be returned in any order.
// It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `0 <= val <= 100`

**Note:**

| Two Pointers | O(n)            | O(1)             |

用一個指標 `k` 指向下一個要寫入的位置，遍歷 `nums`時遇到不等於 `val` 的元素就將該項覆寫到 `k` 位置，再把 `k` 往前移。最後 `k` 就會是移除指定直後的新長度，原陣列也被更新好了。
